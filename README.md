# POO-Project1
This is my first OOP Project at University. I implemented a program that has an interactive menu, the story behind being an Game store. You can add games to the store, where you need to fill in the name of the game, name of the company, total hours of gameplay,etc. You can also print the current games in the store.Also you can delete the last game you added, and the status of the shop is printed all through the navigation. The custom feature is a " Recommend me a game". By some choices selected by the user, the program generates a game suitable for the user.
